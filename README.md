## How to use it

You need to include the **CSS** and **JS** resources located in the `bin` folder. Don't forget to include **jQuery** as well.

````html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="ripple.min.css">

<div class="material-ripple">
  <span>My Account</span>
</div>

<script src="jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="ripple.min.js"></script>
````

You can change the ripple color with the `data-ripple-color` attribute:

````html
<div class="material-ripple" data-ripple-color="#3498db">
  <span>Settings</span>
</div>
````
